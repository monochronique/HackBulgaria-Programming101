    unique id - we should have a way to distinguish them
    battery - unfortunately they cannot run forever but will usually last a flight to the end of the city and back, then they must recharge. We will measure them with BU (battery units).
    capacity - they cannot take infinitely many products as well. We will measure their capacity with WU (weight units)
    charging rate - measured in BU per minutes
